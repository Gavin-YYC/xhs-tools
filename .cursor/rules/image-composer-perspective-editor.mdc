# Image Composer - Perspective Editor

The [PerspectiveEditor.vue](mdc:src/pages/ImageComposer/PerspectiveEditor.vue) component handles interactive perspective transformation of foreground images over a background image.

## Key functionality:
- Allows users to adjust control points to change the perspective of foreground images
- Manages dragging of individual control points and the entire foreground image
- Handles composition of multiple foreground images with a single background image

## Important notes:
- When setting `foregroundImg.value`, use `skipControlPointsUpdate.value = true` to prevent automatic repositioning of control points
- The `composeWithForeground` function applies the same control points to all foreground images
- Make sure to set `skipControlPointsUpdate.value = false` after completing operations that temporarily change the foreground image

## Component workflow:
1. User loads background and foreground images
2. User adjusts control points on the first foreground image
3. On composition, those control points are preserved and applied to all subsequent foreground images

## Related components:

- [ControlPoints.vue](mdc:src/pages/ImageComposer/perspective/ControlPoints.vue) - UI for the control points
