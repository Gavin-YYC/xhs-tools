# Image Composer Workflow

This rule outlines the workflow for the image composition system.

## Application Flow:
1. User imports a background image
2. User imports one or more foreground images
3. User adjusts the perspective of the foreground image
4. System composes all foreground images with the background image
5. User can download individual or all composed images

## Key Components:
- [ImageComposer/index.vue](mdc:src/pages/ImageComposer/index.vue) - Main container component
- [PerspectiveEditor.vue](mdc:src/pages/ImageComposer/PerspectiveEditor.vue) - Handles perspective transformation
- [imageStore.ts](mdc:src/stores/imageStore.ts) - Manages state for images

## Implementation Notes:
- Control points for the first foreground image are preserved and applied to all subsequent images
- Use `skipControlPointsUpdate` flag to prevent automatic control point repositioning
- The ThreeRenderer component handles the actual composition using Three.js
- When implementing new features, ensure proper cleanup in component unmount hooks
