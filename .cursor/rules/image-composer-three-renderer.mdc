# Three.js Renderer Component

The [ThreeRenderer.vue](mdc:src/pages/ImageComposer/perspective/ThreeRenderer.vue) component is responsible for the 3D rendering of images with perspective transformation.

## Core Functionality:
- Creates and manages a Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
- Renders background and foreground images as textured planes
- Applies perspective transformation to the foreground image based on control points
- Provides methods to obtain the final composed image

## Key Methods:
- `render()` - Renders the current scene
- `getCanvasData()` - Returns the composed image as a data URL
- `createBackgroundMesh()` - Sets up the background image mesh
- `createForegroundMesh()` - Sets up the foreground image mesh
- `updatePerspective()` - Updates the foreground mesh based on control points

## Implementation Notes:
- Uses shallowRef for Three.js objects to prevent Vue reactivity issues
- Properly disposes of Three.js resources on component unmount
- Control points are in screen coordinates and converted to normalized device coordinates
- High-quality rendering uses increased pixel ratio for export
